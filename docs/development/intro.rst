Developer Guide
===============

EXPLIoT Framework is a brilliant choice for vendors, smart infrastructure
admins, developers and security researchers for various reasons:

- It will streamline your security/regression testing
- You will be able to identify security loopholes prior to deployment on an
  IoT solution in your infrastructure.
- It will help you in automating time consuming test cases.
- If you fall under any compliance or regulatory requirements for the IoT
  product or Smart Infrastructure, it will help you in automating and
  performing compliance checks regularly.
- It will save a lot of time during IoT security research or assessments
- You can mold it to your needs by simply extending it with your own plugins.

If you are interested in extending the framework i.e. writing new plugins,
follow on.
